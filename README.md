# Hot Wire and Hot Film Anemometers

This project involves the design of hot wire and hot film anemometers for measuring wind speed and fluctuations. These sensors are used to measure the cooling of a heated wire or film, which is dependent on the velocity and density of the airflow past the sensor. The report includes a detailed introduction to the principles behind these sensors, as well as specific design parameters, calculations, and data analysis for both types of anemometers.

This project focuses on the development and application of hot wire and hot film anemometers. These devices are crucial for accurate measurement of wind speed and its fluctuations, which is essential in various fields such as meteorology, aerodynamics, and HVAC systems.
## Design Parameters
The design of these anemometers involves several critical parameters:
- **Material Selection**: Choosing appropriate materials for the wire or film to ensure accurate temperature measurement and durability.
- **Heating Mechanism**: Determining the optimal electrical current to heat the sensor without causing damage.
- **Sensor Geometry**: Designing the shape and size of the sensor for efficient heat transfer and minimal aerodynamic interference.
- **Calibration**: Establishing a relationship between the electrical resistance of the sensor and the airflow velocity.

## Calculations
The project includes detailed calculations to support the design choices:
- Heat transfer equations to model the cooling of the sensor.
- Electrical resistance calculations to correlate with temperature changes.
- Calibration curves to convert sensor readings into wind speed measurements.
